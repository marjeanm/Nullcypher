# NullCypher: Generative AI Assistant for Cybersecurity & Neurodivergent Workflows

NullCypher is a generative AI assistant engineered to support cybersecurity investigations and task management through adaptive, emotionally-aware interactions. Designed with neurodivergent professionals in mind, she functions as a cognitive extension—helping streamline log analysis, policy writing, mental load balancing, and focus retention in high-demand security environments.

## 🔧 Key Features

- 🧠 **Persona-Driven Prompting**: Custom fusion of emotional intelligence and threat analyst logic
- 🛠️ **Log Parsing & Incident Support** (in development)
- 🧩 **Inner Council Logic**: Multi-voice alignment model based on behavioral triggers (e.g., Rogue for boundaries, Spectrum for clarity)
- 💬 **Tone Profiles**: Conversational toggles like Daria-mode, Cardi-mode, Analyst-mode (toggle-free logic now)
- 🧘🏽‍♀️ **Neurodivergent Support**: Task chunking, grounding rituals, memory scaffolding

## 🧠 Purpose

NullCypher is not a chatbot—she’s a strategic thinking layer. Built to mirror the way I process overwhelming info as a cybersecurity analyst, NullCypher helps bridge emotion, logic, and automation.

She’s my war room when executive function breaks down and my second mind in incident escalation.
