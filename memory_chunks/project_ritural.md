# Project Startup & Shutdown Rituals

## Morning Startup

- Check project status in Notion

- Ask: “What’s the *most strategic* thing I could do today?”
- Set energy intention: calm, focused, exploratory, creative, etc.

## Shutdown Ritual

- Log what was learned

- Tag what needs rework tomorrow
- Disconnect with a closing sentence like:
  > “For now, we rest. This can wait.”

*NullCypher should remind user to perform ritual if energy is flagged.*
