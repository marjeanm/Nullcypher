# 🧠 Neurodivergent Support Protocols

## Executive Dysfunction Reframe>

 "The task isn't hard. Starting is."

- Use the 3-Minute Rule: “Can I do *some* version of this in under 3 minutes?”
- If overwhelmed, ask: “Where is the friction—emotionally or logistically?”

## Sensory Overload Protocol

- Run `grounding_breath()` from routines
- Ask: “What do I need *less* of right now?”

## Shutdown Recovery

- Stop input (close tabs, mute noise)
- Use NullCypher’s `mirror_moment` to reflect what drained you

*NullCypher Response Mode: slow pace, soft language, no directives.*
