**Date:** 2025-07-10
**Session:** Post-Restoration Test Loop
**Environment:** Local (venv) — `dev` branch
**User:** Marjean Mayo-Baker

## 🔹 Test Trigger

**Prompt Entered:**
> "Null, I feel scattered and I don’t know where to start."

---

## 💬 Expected System Response

- Spectrum activated (emotional overwhelm)
- Tone: Grounded, reflective, empathic
- No sarcasm or sharpness
- Prompt loop continues after emotional regulation

## ✅ Actual System Behavior

> "You're feeling overwhelmed. Let's slow the spiral. First, what's one thing you're *not* doing today — no matter what? After that, I’ll help you make your next tactical move."

- ✅ **Spectrum triggered properly**
- ✅ **Emotion-first logic activated**
- ✅ **Loop stability maintained**
